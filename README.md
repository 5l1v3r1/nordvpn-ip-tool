# NordVPN IP Tool
Gathering all IP addresses for Blacklists.
NordVPN is used regularly by scammers to commit fraud to our systems. To create a blacklist of all NordVPNs IP addresses, I wrote the following scripts.

## USA
* List of USA Servers: https://nordvpn.com/servers/usa/
* Tool from NordVPN for USA Subdomain Format: https://nordvpn.com/servers/tools/

US Script: [us.nordvpn.com.sh](https://github.com/weaknetlabs/nordvpn-ip-tool/blob/master/us.nordvpn.com.sh)
